# equivariant-ntk

This repository is currently work in progress.

We provide an extension to the [`neural-tangents`](https://github.com/google/neural-tangents) library that implement the NNGP and the NTK of group convolution layers with respect to the roto-translations in the plane and the $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ group.
